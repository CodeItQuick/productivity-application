## Goal

Help me learn angular forms setup

#Change-Log
6/12/2021: Added time-block-services. The tests likely don't work, but now changes in a sub-component can be propagated to the parent (relatively simply)

## TODO:

1. Make the tests work again
2. Wrap tests around the existing components
3. Make a new page that uses subscribe/subject
